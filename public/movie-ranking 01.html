<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Hachi</h3>
<p>The shock lasted for more than month, the after effects. It was all the feeling of
    grief, pain, anxiety that I couldn't even imagine what went through the dog's
    mind that kept waiting.

<h3>Fluke</h3>
<p>
    Another dog movie. Interestingly, this one shows the instance of self reflection,
    self realization, and the lesson to appreciate what you have.

    Seems like that's all I can point out. Others maybe don't fall into the category
    which influenced me a lot.
